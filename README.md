# C Team Project - Sorting Algorithms

In This project we will learn about the sorting algorithms, the stable ones, the Big O notation and the way of evaluating the time complexity of an algorithm and also the way to select the best sorting algorithm.

# Mandatory Tasks

| Task | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| 0-bubble_sort.c | A function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm | 
| 1-insertion_sort_list.c | A function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm |
| 2-selection_sort.c | A function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm |
| 3-quick_sort.c | A function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm |

# Informations:
## Bubble sort:
This is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the input list element by element, comparing the current element with the one after it, swapping their values if needed. These passes through the list are repeated until no swaps had to be performed during a pass, meaning that the list has become fully sorted.

## Insertion sort:
Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and grows a sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain.

## Selection sort:
The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, swapping it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.

## Quick sort:
It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort.[4] The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.
